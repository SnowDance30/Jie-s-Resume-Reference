The project is fully developed by myself.


The project is a simple ball game used pygame module. User needs
to click left or right mouse to catch the ball. The game mainly
uses objected-oriented programming principle.
 
"ball_game-TEXT.txt" is a text file that contains all codes
in this project for convenient viewing.
