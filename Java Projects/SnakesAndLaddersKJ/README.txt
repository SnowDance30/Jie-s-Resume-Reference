The project is fully developed by myself.


The project implements a simple 2-player live game. It is 
implemented by 4 classes, a user-friendly interface with game 
instruction, a main game class using control flows and random 
number generator to control the whole game process, a game board 
using arrays to calculate scores, and a database using XML to 
record game history with sorting and exception check features.
All files are commented.
 
"SnakesAndLaddersKJ-Text.txt" is a text file that contains all 
the java codes in all classes in this project for convenient viewing.
