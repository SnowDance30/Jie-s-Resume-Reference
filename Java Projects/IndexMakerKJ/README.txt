* The project was written when I was studying AP CS exam, so 
the GUI parts is a modification from the textbook (see reference below), 
and was appropriate cited in files. *


The program will read an input file, loading all the information 
inside it, output the words with its respective indices
in another output file. The output file name is  from the command-line 
args or prompts that the user inputs. All files are commented.
 
"IndexMakerKJ-Text" is a text file that contains all 
the java codes in all classes in this project for convenient viewing.
