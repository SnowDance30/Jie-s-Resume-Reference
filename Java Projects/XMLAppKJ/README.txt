The project is fully developed by myself.


The project implements a simple contact tool. It has adding,
 deleting, and displaying functions based on XML, and all files 
 are commented. Users should install the "xom-1.2.10.jar" extension
 to run the project.
 
"XMLAppKJ-TEXT.txt" is a text file that contains all the java codes
in all classes in this project for convenient viewing.
