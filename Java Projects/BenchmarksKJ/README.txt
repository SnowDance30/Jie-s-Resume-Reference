* The project was written when I was studying AP CS exam, so 
the GUI parts is a modification from the textbook (see reference below), 
and was appropriate cited in files. *


The project compares running time of 4 sort algorithms:
sellection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort.
It also uses some swing components to create a GUIS. 
All files are commented.
 
"BenchmarksKJ-Text" is a text file that contains all 
the java codes in all classes in this project for convenient viewing.
